name = "John"
# apparently the %s (string) is a placeholder for a string. Value too?!
print("Hello, %s" % name)

age = 23  # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4288973/whats-the-difference-between-s-and-d-in-python-string-formatting
# %s for string %d for decimal %f float (,) %g for generic number (i dont know what that is)
print("%s is %d years old" % (name, age))

# %s is kinda universal? can be used not only for strings
